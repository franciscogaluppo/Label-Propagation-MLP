## Label Propagation
[Label Propagation](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.3864&rep=rep1&type=pdf) is a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that assigns labels to previously unlabeled vertices. At the start of the algorithm, a (generally small) subset of the vertices have labels. These labels are propagated to the unlabeled vertices throughout the course of the algorithm.
